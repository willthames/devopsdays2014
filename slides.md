# Introduction

## Overview

* Discoverability
* Configurability
* Observability
* Resiliency
* Further reading

## Setting the scene

* 2+ years at Suncorp (2012&ndash;)
* ~8 years at Betfair (2003&ndash;2011)

## A little about Betfair

> * I left in 2011. Much will have changed.
> * 150+ applications
> * &hellip; not that many of which 'looked' the same
> * 1000s of transactions per second, all of which
    were supposed to complete in less than a second
> * 1000s of servers across multiple DCs

. . . 

Genuinely 24x7, highly transactional environment
with low tolerance for downtime.

## A terrible weekend

When Sam Newman tells you that microservices have
to be carefully designed, he's very right

A set of cascading failures across a suite of 
microservices contributed to doing 30+ hours of oncall
in a single weekend.

We came up with a list of 20+ improvements. 

This is a summary of some of those learnings!

##Â And Suncorp
I support a lot of third-party written software
so I have even less power to fix things. But that's 
what support tickets are for.

. . .

Or ranting&hellip; 

# Discoverability

## Standards

![http://xkcd.com/927/](images/standards.png)

## Standards

No support team should have to guess how software is setup.
Have organisational standards that declare:

> * How software is installed (chef, puppet, ansible, salt, cfengine &mdash; just pick one)
> * Where logs live
> * Where configuration comes from, and what the current configuration is
> * How to stop, start, interrogate status of an app

# Configurability

## Configuration Management
> * Terrible: configuration as part of the deployable
> * Good: separate configuration files read at startup
> * Better: configuration read from files after startup
> * Also good if well managed: configuration read from a service (e.g. etcd)

## The configuration monolith
> * Bad: one giant configuration file containing everything from 
    license keys and authentication tokens to configuration
    updated by user interaction at runtime (hi Jenkins and Go!)
> * Better: Configuration files tied to a particular purpose, 
    in an easily templated fashion (think linux conf.d structures)

----------------------
Special mention for this beauty buried deep in a file that
changes every version:

    <!-- Uncomment this to enable this particularly useful configuration
      <some>
        <arbitrary>
          <xml>Make stuff work here</xml>
        </arbitrary>
      </some> 
    -->

Particularly difficult to template or remove specific lines
in a way that works across releases

# Observability

## Logging

* Configure log rotation on a schedule
* Log in an unchanging timezone (UTC, or Australia/Brisbane rather 
  than Australia/Sydney)
* Logs should have a single specific purpose

## Application logs

* Exceptions should be exceptional. `AuthenticationException` when a 
  user mistypes their password is NOT exceptional &mdash; don't log a stack 
  trace for it &mdash; put it in an audit log if need be!
* Know your log parsing tools - writing information as key=value pairs will 
  save you from having to write custom parsers.
* Transaction IDs are great for tying together multiple logs, especially if 
  you can get them in your access log too.

## Access logs

* Access logs should contain the obvious (URL, status code, timestamp etc)
* Less out of the box, log: response time, user ID and *actual* IP address 
  &mdash; i.e. if it comes through a proxy or load balancer, log 
  `X-Forwarded-For` not apparent IP. 
* Be careful of timeouts - not all long running requests make it to the 
  access logs.

. . .

* If you can't use a widely-used access log format, make your access log 
  format standard across your organisation.

## Health status pages

* Health status pages can be used by loadbalancers and humans
* Make your loadbalancer checks be as complete as possible 
  (test connections to critical integration points)
* Make your loadbalancer health checks be as quick as possible
* Have a separate more verbose healthcheck page if need be 
  containing status of DB connections, queue lengths, request counts etc. 
* Allow the healthcheck to recalculate regularly(!!)

# Resiliency

# Further Reading

## Release It
In the last few weeks I've said I could write a book on this. Michael
Nygaard actually has

## Continuous Delivery
Jez Humble and Dave Farley regularly makes the point that 
configuration management is one of the foundations of 
Continuous Delivery and have some great advice:

## Netflix
Netflix are the poster child for designing and delivering operable 
software, telling the rest of us how they do it and sharing their
software!
